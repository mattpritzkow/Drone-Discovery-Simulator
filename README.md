# Drone-Discovery-Simulator
A final project for our Computer Networking Course. I collaborated with Zachary Dean Dussaq to complete the project.

# What does this program do?
Drone Discovery Simulator simulates a group of drones attempting to explore unidentified land. After generating the map with various environments, we randomly assigned a "home-base" from which the drones would deploy from. Each drone was assigned a region to explore, and did so until running out of fuel when it would return to home-base. With an algorithm, we were able to calculate and store each drone's most efficient path both to and from home-base, in order to maximize map discovery in the shortest amount of time.
